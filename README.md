pip install pote

Stuff I've written that don't really fit anywhere else but may be useful in Python projects. Mostly for my own use, I've included them here in case they are useful to others.

Use at your own risk. If you see something interesting, it's probably better to copy the code with all my blessings

They are developed with notebooks using awesome [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), go to [nbs](nbs) to see it in action.
